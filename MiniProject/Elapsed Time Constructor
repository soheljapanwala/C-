Look up the TIMER header files - things time in millisecs 
(elapsed time for a C++ process)
Create a class that has a dynamically allocated 2D double array of nRows by nCols and create a
copy and move constructor and a copy and move assignment operator.  Your basic constructor
initializes it with 0s.
Use the CHRONO library for elapsed time
Then... test...
1. create an instance of your class with 1,000,000 x 1,000,000 elements - time the initial
instantiation.
2. create a copy-constructor&#39;d instance of the class - time that.
3. create a move-constructor&#39;d instance of the class - time that
4. Create a copy-assignment of the class time - time that.
5. Create a move-assignment of the class time -time that.
Print out all the timings
